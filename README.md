# Incident Response Plan for Spendology Solutions

This repository contains an Incident Response Plan (IRP) for Spendology Solutions, outlining a structured approach to detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. The IRP includes the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team, specific procedures for various incident types, and guidelines for post-incident reviews.

## Project Overview

### Purpose & Scope

The purpose of this IRP is to provide a structured approach to managing security incidents effectively and minimizing potential impact on the organization. The scope covers incidents such as ransomware, sensitive data leaks, and malware infections.

### Key Components

1. **Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)**
   - **Roles**: Includes the CISO (incident commander), IT Security (for containment and recovery), and Legal/Compliance (for handling legal and communication aspects).
   
2. **Incident Types**:
   - **Ransomware**: Malicious software that encrypts data and demands a ransom.
   - **Sensitive Data Leak**: Unauthorized exposure of confidential information.
   - **Malware**: Software designed to disrupt or gain unauthorized access.

3. **Incident Severity Matrix**:
   - **High**: Data breaches affecting clients (Immediate response required).
   - **Medium**: Isolated system issues (Response within 1 hour).
   - **Low**: Minor issues with no significant impact (Response within 24 hours).

### Incident Handling Process

The handling process involves six key stages:
1. **Detection**: Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities.
2. **Assessment**: Determine the type and severity of the incident.
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent spread.
4. **Eradication**: Remove malware and patch vulnerabilities.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems from secure backups.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Review incidents and update policies.

### Incident-Specific Procedures

- **Ransomware**: Isolate systems, notify stakeholders, assess backups, avoid ransom payments, coordinate with law enforcement if needed.
- **Sensitive Data Leaks**: Detect, assess the scope, notify affected parties, seal the breach, and engage legal/PR for communications.
- **Malware**: Identify infected systems, contain malware, run scans to remove threats, patch vulnerabilities, and update logs.

### Testing & Review

- **Quarterly Drills**: Simulate ransomware, data leaks, and malware infections to assess preparedness.
- **Annual Review**: Update the incident response plan to incorporate new threats and best practices.
